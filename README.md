# Sales_Tax_Allocation
1.	Introduction and Problem Definition
Sales tax allocation analysis between counties and Metropolitan Transit Authorities (MTAs) and Special Purpose Districts (SPDs) forms the basis of my business problem. The objective targets the examination of sales tax distribution between jurisdictions along with reporting temporal patterns to develop financial strategies and policy decisions.
I selected Python combined with spyder as my development environment for solving this issue. Python enabled me to perform data manipulation using its panda library and visualize my results using its matplotlib and seaborn. The tools enabled me to perform efficient data cleaning operations while quickly seeing trends and detecting vital patterns easily.

2.	Dataset Description
A collection of 7 primary variables makes up the dataset I analyzed.
The data classification includes jurisdiction types which are listed as County, MTA, and SPD.
The dataset contains three different fields which will be analyzed. First is Name (Categorical)-The name of the jurisdiction.
The dataset contains Current Rate (Quantitative which represents the sales tax rate for each jurisdiction.
Net Payment This Period sums up all payments directed toward the present period.
The payments from the same previous time period are recorded as Comparable Payment Prior Year (Quantitative).
Percent Change From Prior Year (Quantitative)- The percentage change in payments from the previous year.
Percent Change To Date (Quantitative)- The cumulative percentage change in payments over time.
Report Month depicts the selected report date as a quarterly selection.
Categorical data indicates monthly or annual status of the report.
According to the data classification system, Report Year provides information about the year during which the report was made.
Data Types and Levels of Measurement:
The data includes the Type and Name fields while Report Period Type and Report Month and Report Year represent categorical elements.
The variables containing numerical or Quantitative values include Current Rate, Net Payment This Period, Comparable Payment Prior Year, Percent Change From Prior Year, Percent Change To Date.

Number of Observations:
Each entry in the time span of multiple years contains data from a particular jurisdiction throughout its designated report month. The dataset contains information about multiple observations which can be validated by reviewing the available data.

Missing Values:
I used this method to verify missing values in the dataset was the dfsales.isnull().sum() technique. A few missing values surfaced within specific columns so I intended to handle them by either filling in missing values or removing cases depending on how these cases would affect my analysis results. This following piece of code shows how to detect missing values in the dataset:

print(dfsales.isnull().sum())  # Output missing value summary
Outliers:
Scatter plots and box plots generated by me displayed outliers representing months or jurisdictions which made unusual or exceptional payments. Special events combined with data entry errors along with economic anomalies represent possible explanations for these outliers. Visualizing the outliers required this code below.

sns.scatterplot(x='Report Month', y='Payments To Date', data=dfsales)
sns.boxplot(x='Report Month', y='Payments To Date', data=dfsales)

Descriptive Statistics:
The analysis included basic descriptive statistics to calculate mean and median and standard deviation from Payments To Date variable for distribution analysis. Here’s the code for this:

print(dfsales['Payments To Date'].describe())  # Summary statistics for Payments To Date

3. Data Processing Steps
i.	As a first step I imported the crucial libraries pandas and seaborn along with matplotlib for data processing activities.
ii.	I inspected the imported data to analyze its structure before performing checks for appropriate column data types.
iii.	I aggregated the data using jurisdiction types (County, MTA, SPD) to find total Payments To Date numbers and additional relevant statistics which allowed comparison between different types of jurisdictions.
iv.	I employed pivot tables to conduct both time-based payment analysis at the monthly and quarterly levels.
v.	The process managed missing values and outliers which emerged during preliminary inspections by replacing missing data with appropriate estimations or applying suitable transformations to deal with outliers.
vi.	 The investigation of payment patterns through time dedication focused on seasonal influences along with policy alterations by studying data at both monthly and quarterly levels.
4. Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations
Quarterly Evolution:
The evaluation of payments progressed through quarters required me to merge data into quarterly segments. Data analysis indicated one or more time periods received increased funding possibly because of seasonal fluctuations or adjustments in policy. These lines of code show the way to generate the quarterly analysis visualization:

quarterly_evolution = dfsales.pivot_table(values='Payments To Date', columns='Quarter', aggfunc='sum')
quarterly_evolution.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Sales Tax Evolution by Quarter')
plt.xlabel('Quarter')
plt.ylabel('Payments To Date')
plt.show()

Seasonal Patterns:
The analysis included a monthly review to discover seasonal trends that could impact payments. Analysis results showed definite peak patterns which probably resulted from fiscal year-end budget distribution or other governmental policy factors. The following code block shows monthly trends analysis:

monthly_trends = dfsales.pivot_table(values='Payments To Date', index='Report Month', aggfunc='mean')
monthly_trends.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 6), title='Average Monthly Sales Tax Allocation')

Categorical Analysis by Jurisdiction Type:
I displayed the complete payments distribution between County and MTA and SPD jurisdiction categories. The assessment revealed that County jurisdictions acquired the biggest portion of total payments. This chart requires the following code to create it.

df_sales_sum = dfsales.groupby('Type')['Payments To Date'].sum().reset_index()
sns.barplot(x='Type', y='Payments To Date', data=df_sales_sum.sort_values(by='Payments To Date', ascending=False))

Results and Insights
Key Findings:
County jurisdictions obtained most total payments while MTAs and SPDs came in second place.
Amounts paid through payments fluctuated at specific periods during selected quarters and months, potentially because of periodic trends alongside policy adjustments.
The reporting data concerning the Percent Change from Prior Year variables alongside the Percent Change To Date variables demonstrated irregular growth patterns because of potential broader economic elements along with special occasions.
The combination of Report Month and Report Period Type measures with additional breakdowns would reveal seasonal analysis findings.
The attached visual representations confirm these research findings.

5. Visualizations and Insights
i. Total Payments by Type
The data visualization displays bar charts that use Matplotlib and Pandas libraries.

 
The counties obtained the greatest collective amount of funding until MTA and SPD received secondary shares.
ii.: Ranking of Allocations
•	Visualization: Seaborn barplot

 
Total allocations from counties dominated all other jurisdictions within the ranking system. The visual display of the different jurisdiction values became immediately apparent.

iii: Average Payments by Type
•	Visualization: Seaborn barplot
  
The average payments across jurisdictions confirmed Counties as the dominant recipient of consistent high funding allocations.
iv. Evolution Over Time
The data displays allocations through bar plots which present both quarterly and annual figures.

 
 
A sustained upward trend existed in the allocations throughout consecutive years. Consumer spending activities produced higher spending patterns in specific quarters (especially Q4) in the data.
v: Seasonal Patterns
•	Visualization: Line chart and bar chart of Report Month trends

 
 
The payment data showed a steady rise with occasional minor peaks and valleys which might show the natural shopping patterns.
vi. Outlier Detection
Histogram (Attempted)
I attempted to display Report Month sales tax allocations through a histogram for distribution analysis. This bar chart displayed uniform value distribution which made all the bars equally visible so I concluded that this method was ineffective for the dataset.
 


6. Conclusion
According to the analysis most of the sales tax allocation funds went to counties resulting in a steady growth pattern throughout the observation period. The data collection maintains perfect compatibility for temporal research and territorial breakdown of information. The majority of recorded variables had categorical data types while Payments To Date functioned as a quantitative measurement together with the features related to date characteristics. The analysis used bar charts together with lines and boxes and scatterplots which brought out essential data patterns and irregularities.
7. Lessons from the Data
The assessment revealed that different jurisdictions use varied distribution methods for their sales tax. The payment rate trends in different areas show either steady progression or pronounced fluctuations. Regional economic strategies vary across different jurisdictions because certain  jurisdictions show higher impacts to shifting tax allocation policies.

8.Reflections and Challenges
Making suitable visual choices beyond raw data presentation was essential because correct decisions helped my communication target. Most graphics displayed at first did not break up clutter or represent the time-window distinction from counties. I performed multiple scale and label adjustment steps as well as formatting modifications until the visuals both clarified the information and improved my analysis goals. This artwork helps me understand the essential role which meaningful analysis and interpretation plays alongside delivering valuable stories to the audience.
